# Flutter Portfolio
This is my professional portfolio; it's a place where I not only show off my projects, but my prowess as a front-end designer. I have worked hard to build a website that is not only tasteful, but enjoyable. When I could build a website that is impressive only to the technically knowledgable, I wanted to also build a website that is fun for the layman.

I also wanted to try out Flutter as I am considering it for future plans. It was also a good excuse to try my had and object-oriented design frameworks since those skills are in high demand. Needless to say, Flutter is very well designed and the way it implements object-oriented typing with the tooling to guide you is unparalled. The developer's experience is clearly put first and formost, and it is obvious to me that Flutter is a labor of love.

That being said, please enjoy my labor of love.
